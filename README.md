# RabbitMQ RPC message 
This package makes ready to use implementation of RabbitMQ RPC tutorial published on:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-php.html
It implements both server side and client. 

**Thanks to this package you will be able to send a message
to RabbtiMQ, then receive this message (on the server side) handle it and finally send the response 
to the client (Producer).**

**Unlike tutorial this package is set to save the queue and messages after RabbtiMQ 
server reboot.**

## Installation
Installation of the package by Composer:
```
composer require tzmudz/rabbitmq_rpc
```
Package uses an *Environment Variables* delivered by `vlucas/phpdotenv` package. 
You have to create an `.env` file in the root folder containing variables:
```dotenv
RABBTIMQ_PORT=5672
RABBTIMQ_HOST=localhost
RABBTIMQ_USERNAME=guest
RABBTIMQ_PASSWORD=guest
```

Thus if you are using e.g. Laravel all you have to do is to put this variables in your `.env` 
app file.
**Notice** If your application doesn’t use `.env` files, don't forget to load them by executing the code:
```php
$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::create(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();
```
You can find more information here: https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv
## Usage
Package comes with two classes: `Producer` and `Consumer`. 
### Producer
The `Producer` class is responsible for delivering messages to RabbtiMQ. 
In your application 
create a new instance of `Tzm\Rpc\Producer()`. As a parameter you can set the queue name 
(by default the name is `default`):
```php
$producer = new Tzm\Rpc\Producer('long_task_queue_name');
``` 

Otherwise you can set the queue name by calling the 
`setQueueName()`. 

```php
$producer = new Tzm\Rpc\Producer();
$producer->setQueueName('long_task_queue_name');
```

Finally you have to call the method `call()` with message as parameter:

```php
$producer = new Tzm\Rpc\Producer();
$producer->setQueueName('long_task_queue_name')->call($message);
```

Where `$message` is a **string** of data that should be send to the RabbtiMQ server. 
Actually RPC sends a message and waits for the response given from server. But, if you don't 
want to wait for server’s response you can use `withoutWaiting()`:
```php
$producet = new Tzm\Rpc\Producer();
$producer->withoutWaiting()->call($message);
```

### Consumer
To process the queued message you need `Consumer` class. This class is abstract. 
You have to create a new class that inherits from `Consumer` abstract class. Then you have to implement 
several methods.

#### handleMessage()

This method is responsible for process the message. It accepts `$message` as 
a parameter e.g.

```php
public function handleMessage($message)
{
    echo $message;
}
```
#### handleError()
Generally it's not necessary, but it handles the error. If the method `handleMessage()` thrown an
error it will be passed to the `handleError()` method. So that you can handle the error however you want. 
e.g. in Laravel you can log the error message:
```php
public function handleError(\Exception $e)
{
    Log::error($e->getMessage());
}
``` 
#### setResults()
After the message is handled RabbitMQ returns a response message. Initially it returns true. But if you want 
you can use `setResult()` method to set the data you want to return. E.g.:

```php
public function handleMessage($message)
{
    $this->setResult('this_will_be_returned_to_Producer');
}
```

#### Run Consumer

Your inherited class of consumer  of `Consumer` should look like this:
```php
namespace Tzm\Rpc;

class EchoMessage extends Consumer
{
    protected function handleMessage($message)
    {
        echo $message;
    }

    protected function handleError(\Exception $e)
    {
        \Log::error($e->getMessage()); // In Laravel Log exception message
    }
}
```
Then you can run the Consumer:
```php
$consumer = new EchoMessage();
$consumer->run();
```
Just like a `Producer` class this one also has a `setQueueName()` method. So you can set the queue name  
when new instance is being created or later by using method. 

#### Console information
Additionally there are two methods:
##### consoleMessage($req) 
It's used to display message in a console. It has one parameter `$req` - containing all the info about the recievied 
message. By default this method returns string: `New request` so if a new message will be delivered 
the console should print: 
```
[04.11 11:03:49] [NEW] New request
[04.11 11:03:49] [OK] New request
```
Whole message could be changed by overriding `consoleInfo()` method.
**ATTENTION!**
Don't forget to run Consumer class first (it will create the queue on RabbitMQ server)
